# Auxiliary Lights

## Auxbeam

## Wiring
- 6-16 tinned copper cable lugs on 6 AWG welding cable with adhesive heatshrink. 

## Truck Power
Used the Upfitter/Snowplow kit (PN 84669070) following [GM Upfitter bulletin 147b](https://www.gmupfitter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/UI-Bulletin_147b-Snow-Plow-power-provisions.pdf) to provide fused 60A to the Auxbeam power terminals.

### Modifications
- Trim the plastic near the 60A terminal so the cable lug would fit flat on the fuse.
