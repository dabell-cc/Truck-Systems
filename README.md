# Truck-Systems
Planning and documenting the truck systems to be installed

## The Truck
- 2021 GMC Sierra 1500 AT4 Gas 5.3L V8
- Rally marshalling, towing car trailers, & general family use (presentation matters - not just a work horse)

## [Amateur Radio](./RadioSystem/Radio.md)
- Transceiver: Kenwood G707A (used)
- Antenna: DIA-NR73BNMO
- Antenna Mount Location: Driver hood fender (custom bracket)

## Auxiliary Lights
- AuxBeam 8 button controller
- Amber strobes in grill
- Bed rail stake pocket temp-mounted side/rear spot lights with amber flashers
- Bed rail stake pocket? side flood lights

## Requirements
- Installation has to be as unobtrusive as possible
- Permanent as possible, but connectorized for swapping out failing components
- Wires protected from damage/general wear during transport use, and through all seasons present in Ontario. (Sun, Rain, Mud, Snow, Ice)
- Avoid creating unserviceable 'chained' OEM parts, where the wiring no-longer allows for removal of trim panels/etc without severing wire.
